        You have just washed ashore on a beach somewhere out in the ocean. You
        look around to see if you can find anyone else here. You no one. You
        find a water bottle that must have washed ashore along with you. You
        know you need to find mer water and food in order to survive. You can't
        see anything else on the beach so you look ahead and see a dense jungle.
        You realize you will need to enter the jungle in order to find food,
        water and shelter, but there could be dangers in there....

        <button id="button1">Enter jungle</button>
        <button id="button2">Stay on beach (and hope for the best)</button>
